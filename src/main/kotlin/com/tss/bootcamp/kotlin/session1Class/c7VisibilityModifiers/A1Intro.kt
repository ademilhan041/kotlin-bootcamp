package com.tss.bootcamp.kotlin.session1Class.c7VisibilityModifiers

// Desc: Classes, objects, interfaces, constructors, and functions, as well as properties and their setters,
//       can have visibility modifiers. Getters always have the same visibility as their properties.

// Desc: For package file:
//         - If you donâ€™t use a visibility modifier, public is used by default, which means that your declarations will be visible everywhere.
//         - If you mark a declaration as private, it will only be visible inside the file that contains the declaration.
//         - If you mark it as internal, it will be visible everywhere in the same module.
//         - The protected modifier is not available for top-level declarations.
//private fun foo() {} // visible inside example.kt
//
//var bar: Int = 5 // property is visible everywhere
//    private set         // setter is visible only in this file
//
//internal val baz = 6    // visible inside the same module


// Desc: For members declared inside a class:
//   - private means that the member is visible inside this class only (including all its members).
//   - protected means that the member has the same visibility as one marked as private, but that it is also visible in subclasses.
//   - internal means that any client inside this module who sees the declaring class sees its internal members.
//   - public means that any client who sees the declaring class sees its public members.
//open class Outer {
//    private val a = 1
//    protected open val b = 2
//    internal open val c = 3
//    val d = 4  // public by default
//
//    protected class Nested {
//        public val e: Int = 5
//    }
//}
//
//class Subclass : Outer() {
//    // a is not visible
//    // b, c and d are visible
//    // Nested and e are visible
//
//    override val b = 5   // 'b' is protected
//    override val c = 7   // 'c' is internal
//    val _d = d
//    val _e = Nested().e
//}
//
//class Unrelated(o: Outer) {
//    // o.a, o.b are not visible
//    // o.c and o.d are visible (same module)
//    // Outer.Nested is not visible, and Nested::e is not visible either
//
//    val _c = o.c
//    val _d = o.d
//}
