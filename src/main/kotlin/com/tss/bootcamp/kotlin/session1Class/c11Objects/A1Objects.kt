// Desc: The Singleton pattern can be useful in several cases, and Kotlin makes it easy to declare singletons
//object DataProviderManager {
//    fun registerDataProvider(provider: Any) {
//    }
//
//    val allDataProviders: Collection<Any> = listOf()
//}

// Desc: This is called an object declaration, and it always has a name following the object keyword.
//       Just like a variable declaration, an object declaration is not an expression, and it cannot be used on the
//       right-hand side of an assignment statement.
//       The initialization of an object declaration is thread-safe and done on first access.
//fun main() {
//    DataProviderManager.registerDataProvider("")
//}

// Desc: Such objects can have supertypes
//abstract class MouseAdapter {
//    abstract fun onScroll(pointer: Int, to: Int)
//}
//
//object MouseAdapterImpl : MouseAdapter() {
//    override fun onScroll(pointer: Int, to: Int) {}
//}
